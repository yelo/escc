This is just a small utility to get
colored output with the aid of escape sequences,
the available modes and colors hides inside the
CODES[] array.

Ex: import escc

    tc = escc.escapeColors()
    tc.textcolor(BG="BLUE", FGMODE="BLINK", FG="GREEN")
    print("This is just another sample string")
    tc.reset()

This would print the sample string in green on a blue
background, and it would also blink the text.

TO-DO: exceptions, make it failsafe
